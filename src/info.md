## I'm a product designer approaching new technologies through code and research. I am fascinated by good use of AI in consumer products, great FinTech or DeFi brandings, and in-depth UX research in EdTech.
<br>

## Outside of client work, [my personal practice](http://www.luoyanxiu.com/) explores the overlap between technology and sensory experiences through writing and installations.
<br>

## A favortite theorist of mine Wendy Chun once said, "Software's vapory materialization and its ghostly interfaces embody a way to navigate our increasingly complex world." And I hope to keep thinking through design on what interface means for us today.
