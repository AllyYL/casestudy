## I'm a product designer with front-end development skills and background in immersive media, research, and storytelling. I design thoughtful interfaces and systems from 0→1 MVPs to speculative tools.
<br><br>

<!-- ## I've worked with early-stage startups, research labs, and mission-driven teams to bring digital experiences to life—often building from scratch while contributing to both UX strategy and visual design.
<br><br> -->

## Outside of client work, [my personal practice](http://www.luoyanxiu.com/) explores the overlap between technology, the body, and sensory experiences—bringing a critical and artistic lens to my design work.
