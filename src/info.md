## I'm a product designer with front-end development skills and background in creative tech. Currently at Harvard FAS CAMLab, previously at bloom3d, Parsons, and the Martin Agency.
<br>

## A favortite theorist of mine Wendy Chun once said, "*Software's vapory materialization and its ghostly interfaces embody—conceptually, metaphorically, virtually—a way to navigate our increasingly complex world.*" And I hope my design can address it through their thinkings and details.

 <br>

## Outside of client work, [my personal practice](http://www.luoyanxiu.com/) explores the overlap between technology, the body, and sensory experiences—bringing a critical and artistic lens to my design work.
