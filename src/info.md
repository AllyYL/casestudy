## I'm a product designer with front-end web development experience. I turn concepts into thoughtful interfaces and engaging narrativesâ€”with just the right amount of open-endedness. I build innovative tools and digital experiences from the ground up, collaborating with creative labs and early-stage startups. 
<br><br>

## I received my MFA in Design and Technology from Parsons and have a background in Film from Wesleyan Univeristy. I would loosely call myself an artist-in-the-making when it comes to [my own practice](http://www.luoyanxiu.com/), which often explores the overlap between hardware and wetware.
