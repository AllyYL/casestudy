## I’m a product designer with front-end development skills and a background in immersive media, research, and storytelling. I design thoughtful interfaces and systems—from 0→1 MVPs to speculative tools—with a focus on clarity, creativity, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.
<br><br>

## I’ve worked with early-stage startups, research labs, and mission-driven teams to bring digital experiences to life—often building from scratch while contributing to both UX strategy and visual design. My approach blends creative tech, systems thinking, and narrative design to create interfaces that are intuitive and meaningful.
<br><br>

## I earned my MFA in Design and Technology from Parsons, and my BA in Film from Wesleyan University. Outside of client work, [my personal practice](http://www.luoyanxiu.com/) explores the overlap between technology, the body, and sensory experiences—bringing a critical and artistic lens to my design work.
