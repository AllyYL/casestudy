"Shower Thoughts" is an artist book combining quirky social experiments, serious theories, and artwork documentation—all centered on the shower.

Moving beyond these experiments, the book examines the eco- and techno-political dimensions of showers as both personal experiences and networked systems, aiming to reveal how showers create the illusion of individual sterility while uncovering the infrastructure of that illusion. By drawing on post-digital aesthetics and science and technology studies, the book reframes our commonsense beliefs about autonomy, illustrating how repetitive bodily actions network isolated “users” into larger systems, much like digital networks, forming an unconscious community. Ultimately, the book explores the blurred boundaries between private and public, wet and dry, and individual and collective.
