## Overview

WEAVE is a Web3 ecommerce app offering users the ability to purchase both physical garments and their NFT counterparts at the same time. I was brought in as a product designer to **build a unified UI system, overseeing the extended product pages** and **social sharing flow**. I developed the MVP for invester demo. With an emphasis on integrating blockchain-backed sustainable tracking into the user flow, I also focused on **data visualization** for sustainability information.

## Competitive Analysis

An audit of supply chain tracking and e-commerce apps revealed an opportunity to merge the two—transforming raw supply chain data into a social, story-driven shopping experience, WEAVE's core differentiator. In case you are interested, I've also compiled [an initial report](https://medium.com/@luoyanxiu/designing-for-impact-a-case-study-on-integrating-nfts-for-a-transparent-and-sustainable-fashion-f26fdc6e5cbf).

## UX Research

<div class="layout-threecolumn-2">

</div>
<br>

What does sustainable fashion mean to online shoppers — and **what would convince users to switch platforms**? What builds credibility, curiosity, and conversion in a crowded, trend-sensitive market? 

After conducting **in-person user interviews** with online shoppers, designers, and NFT collectors, hosting brand engagement sessions, collecting **Google form survey data**, and creating **user journey mapping**, we identified and understood current users' needs. 

<div class="quote-container">
  <p>Numbers won't win me over. Zara has done that too many times with their carbon-offset. Give me something I should care about.</p>
  <cite>— Anonymous shopper</cite>
</div>

<div class="quote-container">
  <p>I've yet to find a place where I can shop both physical AND digital fashion at the same time.</p>
  <cite>— Hannah, Fashion designer</cite>
</div>

<div class="quote-container">
  <p>It's one thing to own. To participate and be part of it--that's a whole lot more attractive.</p>
  <cite>— NFT Collector</cite>
</div>

<br>

Our research surfaced a few consistent themes:

<ol style="list-style-position: decimal inside; padding-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li style="padding-left: 1em;">Users are skeptical of vague sustainability claims
	<li style="padding-left: 1em;">Social media and brand signaling played a bigger role than expected in conversion
</ol>

Through user interviews, we zeroed in on our Persona.

<br>

Now, let's tackled these three objectives one by one.

<br>


## Wireframe: Tackling Phygital Integration

The core flow guides new users to register, browse, and buy physical garment AND digital NFTs in one seamless experience.

![WEAVE's primary user flow](/assets/images/WeavePrimaryFlow.webp)

A secondary flow exists when a user already owns a physical garment and wants to access its NFT twin through the app.

## User Testing: Information for Depth, Not Overload

With a solid foundation in place, I created a minimal prototype. The usability study surfaced key friction points, leading to several major design changes. The most significant on is applying more dynamic, physical interactions to card UI.

<br>

<div class="layout-twocolumn">
    <div class="column-left">
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>The full supply chain breakdown was shown upfront, overwhelming users who were here to shop.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-right">
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p><strong>A dynamic card stacknig visual that shows</strong> high-level summary before checkout and a full supply chain tracking experience post-purchase.</p>
    </div>
</div>

![Before and after userflow for guest checkout](/assets/images/usertest2.png)

<br>

<!-- ### ① Perfecting Integrated Checkout

<div class="layout-twocolumn">
    <div class="column-left">
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Wallet setup was mandatory before checkout, leading to drop-offs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-right">
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Introduced <strong>guest checkout</strong> with auto-wallet creation by email. <strong>Wallet setup is deferred to post-purchase</strong>.</p>
    </div>
</div>

## Kicking it up to high fidelity

I started shaping WEAVE's visual design by gathering references, research, and inspiration to define its brand identity.

<!-- <div class="highlight-text">
    The magic of strong visuals and digestable narratives for socials.
</div> -->

Each step in the garment history and each stakeholder in the supplychain is brokendown into digestable, sharable pieces. Meeting the needs of social-native users.

WEAVE launched a private TestFlight beta (invite-only) to ~150 targeted users. The combination of interactive product storytelling and simplified checkout encouraged faster decisions from first-time buyers; 22% of users posted at least one product story, comment, or review within 30 days, signaling strong early engagement.

The closed beta achieved above-average engagement and conversion, but the company paused public launch due to funding constraints. The product's design insights continue to inform related projects and future opportunities.
