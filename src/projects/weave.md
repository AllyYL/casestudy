## Context

WEAVE is a blockchain startup in the fashion space, using NFTs to help brands visualize their supply chains through NFTs. I focused on **simplifying complex data into a clean, human-centered interface** that tells the story of a productâ€™s journeyâ€”from seed to store.

For the product demo, we prioritized **mission-critical features that could drive conversion and resonate with trend-aware early adopters**, while balancing the complexity of an experimental web3 concept.

        <p>WEAVE blends emerging technology with familiar shopping habits. The challenge was to design a seamless user experience that:
        <br><br> <strong>1. lowers the barrier to entry, <br>2. communicates value early, <br>3. drives engagement with an unfamiliar but promising product model.</strong><br><br>
        So, how did we do that?

## Competitive Analysis

<div class="layout-twocolumn">
    <div class="column-left">
        <img src="/assets/images/competitive.webp" alt="logos from competing companies in the crypto and e-commerce industries" style="max-height: 40%, width: auto;">
    </div>
    <div class="column-right">
        <p>I conducted a competitive audit across two key spaces: <strong>Blockchain-backed</strong> supply chain platforms, including IBM Food Trust, Provenance, Trace Network, and Slavery Footprint; <strong>E-commerce platforms</strong>, such as GOAT, SSENSE, Depop, and Etsy â€” all leading in user experience, community, and commerce design.</p>
        <br>
        <p>WEAVE differentiates itself by <strong>combining NFT-based supply chain tracking with a social-native e-commerce experience</strong>. Where competitors focus on either provenance or community, WEAVE unites both â€” turning transparency into <strong>shareable storytelling</strong>.</p>

## User Research

What does sustainable fashion mean to online shoppers â€” and what would convince them to switch? Through surveys and interviews with 14 potential users, we explored how they perceive credibility, trust, and innovation in fashion.

<div class="highlight-text">
    What actually builds credibility, curiosity, and conversion in a crowded, trend-sensitive market? 
</div>

<br>

We interviewed potential users from three target areas and narrowed down our ideal customer profile. What they said helped us find alignment on who they are, and guided us on what we are making.

## Wireframe

The most important action new users can take is to **register, access the marketplace, and make their purchase**. This is the app's primary flow. I charted a basic version, taking into consideration choices users might want to make, and specifying a clear happy path, which would allow me to start structuring the content within the app.

![WEAVE's primary user flow](/assets/images/Weave Primary Flow.webp)

A secondary flow exists **when a user already owns a physical garment** and wants to access its NFT twin through the app. This can be done by tapping at an NFC tag that comes along with garment purchase.

## User Testing

With a solid foundation in place, I created a minimal prototype and gathered feedback from the WEAVE team and other designers. The usability study surfaced key friction points, leading to two major design changes:

## â‘ 

<div class="layout-twocolumn">
    <div class="column-left">
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Wallet setup was mandatory before checkout, leading to drop-offs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-right">
        <h3>ðŸ™‚ Solution</h3>
        <p>Introduced <strong>guest checkout</strong> with auto-wallet creation by email. <strong>Wallet setup is deferred to post-purchase</strong>.</p>
    </div>
</div>

        <p>The full supply chain breakdown was shown upfront, overwhelming users who weren't sustainability-conscious.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-right">
        <h3>ðŸ™‚ Solution</h3>
        <p><strong>Dynamic information synthesis</strong>â€”high-level summary before checkout and a full supply chain tracking experience post-purchase.</p>
    </div>
</div>

## Prototype: Kicking it up to high fidelity

I started shaping WEAVE's visual design by gathering references, research, and inspiration to define its brand identity. Since transparency and traceability are at the heart of WEAVE, I wanted the visual language to feel trustworthy, tactile, and elegantly functional, bridging the digital and physical seamlessly.

<div class="fullwidth-image-container">

</div>

Each step in the garment history and each stakeholder in the supplychain is brokendown into digestable, sharable pieces. Meeting the needs of social-native users.

## Future Recommendations

Looking ahead, future releases could explore low-tech accessibility, community engagement, scalability. After all, no digital experience is ever truly finishedâ€”it evolves, just like the garments we wear.
