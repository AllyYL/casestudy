# Product Journey as Story: Layering Supply Chain Data into a Social UX

<br>

## Context

WEAVE is a blockchain startup in the fashion space, using NFTs to help brands visualize their supply chains through NFTs. I focused on **simplifying complex data into a clean, human-centered interface** that tells the story of a product's journeyâ€”from seed to store.

For their early MVP, I created a card-based interface that transforms complex supply chain data into visual stories. The application simplifies long product journeys through flip-card mechanics that reveal detail only when neededâ€”and stack into social, shareable threads.

## Result

<div class="layout-threecolumn">
    <div class="column-left">
        <h3>Conversion Rate</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="column-right">
        <p>Above industry average at 12.4%, improved product discovery and checkout flow reduced hesitation and <strong>helped first-time buyers convert faster</strong>.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="layout-threecolumn">
    <div class="column-left">
        <h3>User-Generated Content</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="column-right">
        <p><strong>Over one-third</strong> of testing users posted at least <strong>one product story, comment, or review</strong> (measured over a 30-day period).</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="layout-threecolumn">
    <div class="column-left">
        <h3>Platform Stickiness</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="column-right">
        <p>With a DAU/MAU ratio at 31% , testing users <strong>return regularly</strong> for updates, not just purchases.</p>

        <h1>Challenge</h1><br>
        <p>Fashion sustainability data is complex and often opaque. The challenge was to visualize this in a way that felt intuitive, transparent, and elegantâ€”without overwhelming users.

## Competitive Analysis

    </div>
    <div class="column-right">
        <p>Most platforms focus on either traceability or communityâ€”not both. Through a quick audit of blockchain and e-commerce tools, I found space to merge the two: <strong>turning raw supply chain data into a social, story-driven experience</strong>. This became WEAVE's core differentiator.</p>

## User Research

What does sustainable fashion mean to online shoppers â€” and what would convince them to switch platforms? 

To explore this, we conducted surveys and in-depth interviews with 14 potential users. We focused on perceptions of credibility, trust, and innovation in the context of fashion transparency.

<br>

<div class="quote-container">
  <p>I've yet to find a place where I can shop both physical AND digital fashion at the same time.</p>

  <p>It's one thing to own. To participate, be on-chain, and be part of it--that's a whole lot more attractive.</p>

</div>

<br>

Our research surfaced a few consistent themes:

<ol style="list-style-position: decimal inside; padding-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
    <li style="padding-left: 1em;">Users are skeptical of vague sustainability claims
	<li style="padding-left: 1em;">Users were drawn to an integrated platform with physical and digital capacities
	<li style="padding-left: 1em;">Social sharing and brand signaling played a bigger role than expected in conversion
</ol>

## Wireframe: Tackling Phygital Integration

The core flow guides new users to **register, browse, and buy physical garment AND digital NFTs** in one seamless experience.

A secondary flow exists when a user already owns a physical garment and wants to access its NFT twin through the app.

## Paper Prototyping: Card System 

Paper prototyping helped us translate physical gestures into digital interactions.
Drawing from clothing tags, we mocked up cards to test how much info users could absorb at a glanceâ€”and when theyâ€™d want to flip.

## User Testing

With a solid foundation in place, I created a minimal prototype. The usability study surfaced key friction points, leading to two major design changes:

## â‘  Perfecting Integrated Checkout

<div class="layout-twocolumn">
    <div class="column-left">
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Wallet setup was mandatory before checkout, leading to drop-offs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-right">
        <h3>ðŸ™‚ Solution</h3>
        <p>Introduced <strong>guest checkout</strong> with auto-wallet creation by email. <strong>Wallet setup is deferred to post-purchase</strong>.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="fullwidth-image-container">

</div>

## â‘¡ Information for Depth, Not Overload

<div class="layout-twocolumn">
    <div class="column-left">
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>The full supply chain breakdown was shown upfront, overwhelming users who were here to shop.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-right">
        <h3>ðŸ™‚ Solution</h3>
        <p><strong>A dynamic card stacknig visual that shows</strong>high-level summary before checkout and a full supply chain tracking experience post-purchase.</p>
    </div>
</div>

## Prototype: Kicking it up to high fidelity

I started shaping WEAVE's visual design by gathering references, research, and inspiration to define its brand identity.

<div class="highlight-text">
    The magic of strong visuals and digestable narratives for socials.
</div>

Each step in the garment history and each stakeholder in the supplychain is brokendown into digestable, sharable pieces. Meeting the needs of social-native users.

## Future Recommendations

This project taught me the importance of simplifying complex information and the value of user-centered design in building trust and engagement. It reinforced my belief in the power of design to make sustainability more accessible and understandable.
