# Digital Temple

An interactive web archive designed for immersive learning

## Context

Digital Temple is a series of **interactive web archives** that use **3D visualization** to preserve and revitalize remote cultural heritage sites. The platform reimagines how digital tools can support education, access, and long-term preservation of fragile architectural spaces.

One of the featured sites, **Kaihua Monastery**, has been adopted as a **classroom tool at Harvard University**, where it supports undergraduate and graduate courses in spatial storytelling, architectural analysis, and digital heritage studies.

As lead **UI/UX designer** and **project manager**, I collaborated with a cross-disciplinary team of scholars, architects, visual artists, and musicians to translate complex research into an immersive, accessible user experience.

## Highlight: A Unified Spatial Interface

A key design achievement was translating Kaihua Monastery's complex visual program into an **interactive 3D web experience** that **doesn't fragment the user journey**. Instead of separating research, images, and data across disconnected pages (as many heritage platforms do), we **embedded historical content directly within the reconstructed space**.

<div class="highlight-text">
    An all-in-one interface combining 2D, 3D, and contextual narrative.
</div>

<br>

By layering research, spatial data, and multimedia content into a **single immersive interface**, users intuitively explore the site—moving fluidly between 2D murals, 3D architecture, and contextual narratives, all within their native environments.

## Design Challenges

Working closely with scholars in East Asian Studies, Architecture, Art History, and photogrammetry, our task was to translate dense academic research into visually intuitive, interactive experiences. However, **it is not without losses**: academic researches are layered and labyrinthian, yet graphics are usually very upfront.

<div class="highlight-text">
   How might we preserve the depth of scholarship without overwhelming the user?
</div>

<img src="/assets/images/templeinsert.webp" alt="A flowchart showing research to design process">

We navigated this tension by building an interface that doesn't oversimplify but invites **layered exploration**, embedding research organically into spatial cues and interactive storytelling.

    <img src="/assets/images/academictimeline.webp" alt="A flowchart showing research to design process">
    </div>
<br><br>

### Solution: Simplification

<br><br>

### Solution: Reinterpretation

<br><br>

We ultimately made a **key trade-off**: **simplifying certain mural details** and scholarly interpretations in favor of a visualization style tailored to modern audiences. By adding a hint of theatricality and narrative rhythm, we aimed to spark curiosity and **draw users into deeper engagement**, rather than overwhelm them at the start.

## Research & Insights

We conducted **domain research**, **affinity mapping**, and **user interviews** to explore the intersection of digital archives and web-based interaction.

<img src="/assets/images/domain.webp" alt="A domain research map">

We found that most archives either lack interactivity or oversimplify content—revealing a gap between engagement and depth.

We conducted two rounds of interviews. In the first round of user research, we interviewed 21 researcher-educators and undergraduate students. These insights validated a key pain point: **fragmented navigation breaks the spatial narrative**. We needed a more integrated experience that supports both exploration and context.

## Prototyping & User Testing

We tested best ways to showcase information that considers both readability and displaying as much original information as possible.

<br>

After establishing usability testing metrics, we interviewed 10 participants from diverse academic and demographic backgrounds. We identified 35 usability issues from the usability tests and devised 18 actionable items.

## Reflections

Aside from much rumination over content, I was also interested in exploring those 4 topics through this project:

**Visual design with and through creative technology** <br>
As a small media lab, we try to connect creative tech with academic research as well as public interest. Visual design is the bridge that connects them.

**Making complexities simple**<br>
Academic researches are layered and labyrinthian, yet we realize graphics are usually very upfront. How does the latter convey the former?

**Multidisciplinary collaboration, done remotely** <br>
How do you talk to, make request from, and send assets to developers, architects, scholars, visual artists, writers, and those who come in to play test?

**Managing is a maker's skill** <br>
I became a project manger in the second iteration of design, and it felt very different to be in a managing role.
