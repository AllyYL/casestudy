# Digital Temple

An interactive web archive designed for immersive learning

## TL;DR

From architectural space to speculative UX—**this project explores how cultural research can drive interface design**. I led the design for a 360° virtual experience of the Kaihua Monastery, transforming historical space into an interactive environment through an immersive web experience.

<br>

## Context

As lead product designer and project manager, I worked with [Harvard FAS CAMLab](https://camlab.fas.harvard.edu/) to build a website for exploring the Kaihua Monastery. This project translates scholarly research into an intuitive, web-based interface—inviting users to navigate spatial narratives, interact with 3D reconstructions, and engage with religious art in context.

I led the project from concept to execution, working across user research, interaction design, and cross-functional collaboration to bring the experience to life.

## From Academic Research to Design

Working closely with scholars, our task was to translate dense academic research into visually intuitive, interactive experiences. However, **it is not without losses: academic researches are layered and labyrinthian, yet graphics are usually very upfront**.

<br>

<div class="highlight-text">
   How might we preserve the depth of scholarship without overwhelming the user?

    <img src="/assets/images/academictimeline.webp" alt="A flowchart showing research to design process">
    </div>
<br><br>

Here I've selected three design approaches that addresses the above concerns:

<br>

### One Dimension Up: Turning Complexity into Spatial Clarity

Murals medieval China often feature intersecting perspectives that obscure visual clarity. To make them navigable, We lifted the mural into 3D.

<br><br>

### Embed Information in Its Environment

Rather then seperating content from context, we tried to maximize teh affordances of web to layer information.

<br><br>

### Theatricality

We recreated lighting from the murals in 3D space—transforming visual cues into ambient effects that evoke the original atmosphere. 

By adding a hint of theatricality, we hoped to spark curiosity and **draw users into deeper engagement**.

<br>


## Domain Research

We conducted **domain research**, **affinity mapping**, and **user interviews** to explore the intersection of digital archives and web-based interaction.

<br>

<img style="text-align: center" src="/assets/images/domain.webp" alt="A domain research map">

<br><br>

We found that most archives either lack interactivity or oversimplify content—revealing a gap between engagement and depth.

<div class="quote-container">
  <p>I wanted to see where the murals are located, but that means exiting the page and opening a new one with an architecture model that has nothing in it.</p>
  <cite>— Aaron, 21, Boston</cite>
</div>

<br>

We also conducted two rounds of interviews. In the first round of user research, we interviewed 21 researcher-educators and undergraduate students. These insights validated a key pain point: **fragmented information hinders learning**.

<br>

<div class="dark-blue-section">
    <br><br>
    <div class="plain">
        <h2>Mission Statement</h2><br>
        <p>Design an interactive web experience where architectural space shapes the design—both spatially and academically—and vice versa.</p>
    </div>
    <br><br>
</div>

<br>

## Prototyping & User Testing

Moving through rapid animated prototyping under mission-critical guidelines, we experimented with different layouts, interactions, and user flows.

<br><br>

In the second design iterations, after establishing usability testing metrics, we interviewed 10 participants from diverse academic and demographic backgrounds. We identified 35 usability issues from the usability tests and devised 18 actionable items.

## Highlight: A Unified Spatial Interface

A key design achievement was translating Kaihua Monastery's complex visual program into an **interactive 3D web experience** that **doesn't fragment the user journey**. Instead of separating research, images, and data across disconnected pages (as many heritage platforms do), we **embedded historical content directly within the reconstructed space**.

<br>

<div class="highlight-text">
    An all-in-one interface combining 2D, 3D, and contextual narrative.
</div>

<br>

By layering research, spatial data, and multimedia content into a **single immersive interface**, users intuitively explore the site—moving fluidly between 2D murals, 3D architecture, and contextual narratives, all within their native environments.

## Reflections

Aside from much rumination over content, I was also interested in exploring those 4 topics through this project:

**Visual design with and through creative technology** <br>
As a small media lab, we try to connect creative tech with academic research as well as public interest. Visual design is the bridge that connects them.

**Making complexities simple**<br>
Academic researches are layered and labyrinthian, yet we realize graphics are usually very upfront. How does the latter convey the former?

**Multidisciplinary collaboration, done remotely** <br>
How do you talk to, make request from, and send assets to developers, architects, scholars, visual artists, writers, and those who come in to play test?

**Managing is a maker's skill** <br>
I became a project manger in the second iteration of design, and it felt very different to be in a managing role.
