# Building (a niche) AI-Native Design Tool

[Bloom](https://bloom3d.io/) is a niche, yet very chic, AI-native design tool for pattern makers and fashion designers. It is an ambitious project, and I had (still have) big dreams for it to be as edgy as the users we target. But we ran into some issues that are unexpected in a traditional UX design project, and unique to MVP-building under tight timeline and budget. I thought I should comb through and reflect on what I've learned so far as a product designer.

    <li>A lot of AI startups have a solution first, then they go about and find the right users and problems. What does that mean for a traditional UX research process?

Fashion design can be very conversational, especially between pattern makers and designers, which makes CUI-based AI incorporation very exciting.

## Conversational Interface vs Graphical Interface

~~Despite all, an interface is designed to govern and hide.~~ A friendly and well-designed interface empowers and creates productive individuals. We set out to make a chat-based interface for fashion designers to quickly make production-ready patterns out of texts or images.

The nature of pattern making—starting with broad foundations and gradually layering in precision—calls for a blend of CUIs and GUIs, each serving distinct roles in the workflow.

    For detailed technicals, I would rather hire a pattern maker, as these details are difficult to communicate through text to an AI, however, hiring a pattern maker is costly at roughly $200/hour, so any time-saving solutions are valuable.
